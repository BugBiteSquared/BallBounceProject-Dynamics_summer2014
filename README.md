# BallBounceProject-Dynamics_summer2014
This is my code and the write-up for my dynamics project of summer 2014. It simulates a bouncing ball with initial conditions and coefficient of restitution as parameters. RK4 is used for solving for the kinematics of the system, and my implementation is included in the repo. The collision code was written from scratch by me.

The code was written in Matlab's scripting language in a non-object-oriented style so my teammates could collaborate on the code with me. I would have preferred to use Python instead and package some of the functions in a more object-oriented fashion, but none of my teammates would have been able to maintain or understand the code if I did that. As a result, the code quality isn't exactly what I would call production ready.
